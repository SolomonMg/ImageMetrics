As a result, theories and methods that have proven powerful in 1 topic area are often not applied in other areas, even to conceptually similar issues. The authors adopt a theoretically integrative approach to the topic of intergroup relations. Theories and empirical approaches from the domains of attitudes, impression formation, the self, personal relationships, and norms offer many new insights into problematic issues, such as repeated findings of dissociations among stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. This integrative approach not only promises new theoretical advances, but also suggests numerous potential practical approaches to limiting or reducing destructive patterns of intergroup relations.},

	abstract = {For the past 40 years, social psychological research on stereotyping and prejudice in the United States has been dominated by the social cognition perspective, which has emphasized the important role of basic categorization processes in intergroup dynamics. An inadvertent consequence of this approach has been a disproportionate focus on social categorization as a causal factor in intergroup animosity and, accordingly, an emphasis on approaches that minimize category distinctions as the solution to intergroup conflict. Though recognizing the crucial function of categorization, we question existing support for the hypothesis that the perception of strong group differences necessarily results in greater intergroup bias. Given that it is neither feasible nor ultimately desirable to imagine that social categories can be eliminated, we suggest that a more useful approach is one that promotes intergroup harmony even while recognizing and valuing the distinctions that define our social world.},

The results show that the probability to invite {Arab-Muslim} job applicants decreases by five percentage points when the recruiter has a one standard deviation stronger negative implicit association toward {Arab-Muslim} men. This suggests that automatic processes may exert a significant impact on employers' hiring decisions, offering new insights into labor market discrimination.},

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that attitude {BIATs} had satisfactory validity when good (but not bad) was a focal category, and that identity {IATs} had satisfactory validity when self (but not other) was a focal category. Experiment 2 also showed that a good-focal attitude {BIAT} and a self-focal identity {BIAT} were psychometrically similar to standard {IAT} measures of the same constructs. Experiment 3 presented each of six {BIATs} twice, showing that procedural variables had no more than minor influences on the resulting implicit measures.
